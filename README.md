# Guessing Game

This is a simple terminal game I made while learning Python.

This game uses the randint function from the random library to select a number between 1 and 100. Users have seven attempts to guess the correct number, and while they have remaining attempts they can enter new guesses. For each guess they are told if it is too high or too low.

```$ git clone https://github.com/hpellis/guessing_game```
